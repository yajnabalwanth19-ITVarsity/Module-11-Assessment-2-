                        <p>New York is known for its towering skyscrapers, famous districts, and endless energy. From baseball and burgers to Times Square and yellow cabs, there's a lot to explore in the Big Apple. Amongst the metropolitan boroughs, New York is also famous for its nature including Thousand Island and Finger Lake regions but most importantly New York is famous for their <strong><em>Pizzas</em></strong>.</p>
                        <p>I had the opportunity to visit the infamous Di Fara Pizza. They are famous for their New York–style pizza made with a characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust. The crust is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat. With a classic pepperoni topping, I was in heaven!</p>
                        <p>I can't wait to go back and this is one of the must see places to get the tastiest New-York-Style pizza.</p>

                        <p>South Korea is an extraordinary country filled with beautiful beaches, thriving cities, ancient temples, remarkable natural scenery, friendly people and the centre of joyous get-togethers, food. The bustling capital is where I spent a week.</p>
                        <p>I had the opportunity to visit the infamous Choigozip situated in the neighbourhood of Hongdae(홍대). Samgyeopsal(삼겹살) is a South Korean delicacy consisting only of pork belly. It is usually eaten with Kimchi(김치), Perilla leaves(깻잎), Lettuce and Ssamjang(쌈장). It is usually meant for socialising while enjoying a glass of Soju(소주).The meat was tender and the service was immaculate.</p>
                        <p>I can't wait to go back! You have to try Samgyeopsal(삼겹살) with friends. </p>

                        <p>Mumbai is a mix of iconic old-world charm architecture, strikingly modern high rises, cultural and traditional structures, and whatnot. The city is known as the commercial capital of India, but there is more to it than that. Mumbai is all about art, history, culture, food, theatre, cinema, nightlife and a lot more.</p>
                        <p>I had the opportunity to visit Manuhaar. They offered a range of Indian cuisine. I had the chicken curry with perfectly, soft roti. The food was packed with flavour and abit spicy. Just how I like it! Manuhaar offers a range of traditional indian desserts which are sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. If you are ever in Mumbai, be sure to pop into Manuhaar. The staff was pleasant.</p>
                        <p>I can't wait to go back.</p>
